        <p>This is an app created for those who desire to live a healthy lifestyle while living on a low budget for food.<br>
        This app is currently still in its beta stage due to the fact that the program used isn't the best. I am planning<br>
	to make a official version of this app in a better, more clean and efficient program as soon as I can.

        <p> This app was made by the idea of making something food-related, it also ended up getting some attention from one of our group member's mothers.<br>
        She provided the idea of a college-food app. Then, in our small group, we started to plan. After three days, we had a plan.<br>
        This was mainly a combination of four of our other trashed attempts. Our app would consist of a simple self-expanitory landing page.<br>

        <p>
		I am a freshman at a high school in fresno, CA. I have been coding for three years now, <br>
		knowing the lanuages java, javascript, html, CSS, and Python. I'm trying to pursue a degree <br>
		in computrer science and computer engineering. I am planning to be an intern for <br>
		Edwards Air Force Bace and I am planning on attending several programming camps for Stanford and <br>
		Bitwise (Fresno). I will try to pursue as amny activities to help me get my name out for colleges <br>
		to notice. This is so that I can have an attempt to attend UC Irvine for college to major in both <br>
		Computer Science and a Computer Engineering degree.

			run a story that has multiple endings based on the user's inputs in the file.</p>

        <p>This is a sample of the code used in my Hangman game. The game was made to simulate the real game of Hangman with <br>
		a plethora of words for the computer to chose from. This game would last for the amount of lims on the drawn chacter. <br>
		I also included the option of replaying the game. This took me a week and a half to do my first draft, but I decided <br>
		to redo it in another approach, which turned into a successful program in about three days.

		This is my final project for Python. It was a story that was made in a group of two, my other companion being Thomas Ortiz. <br>
		The story is placed in a small town next to a mythical forest. The story's main characters TANK and BOMAR, are attempting to <br>
		expose the long corrupt company run by a german scientist. Their abitions are still unknown, but hey will give it all they have <br>
		to save their sacred forest.
