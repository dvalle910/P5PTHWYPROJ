        <p id="1">This is an app created for those who desire to live a healthy lifestyle while living on a low budget for food.<br>
        This app is currently still in its beta stage due to the fact that the program used isn't the best. I am planning<br>
	to make a official version of this app in a better, more clean and efficient program as soon as I can.

        <p id="2"> This app was made by the idea of making something food-related, it also ended up getting some attention from one of our group member's mothers.<br>
        She provided the idea of a college-food app. Then, in our small group, we started to plan. After three days, we had a plan.<br>
        This was mainly a combination of four of our other trashed attempts. Our app would consist of a simple self-expanitory landing page.<br>

			<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/122000861/">Scratch</a><br><p>This was no where near code, but it was a program that we had to copy someone else's work, twaek it, and then claim it ours. Very similar to stealing, but the site encourages this behavour for kids.</p></li>

			<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a><br><p>This was an introduction to coding by completing online lessons on this neatly organized website.</p></li>
			<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad ++</a><br><p>This was the first real-life coding task in this class, in here we were tasked of creating two different websites in order to show our skills to the class.</p></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/dvalle910">GitHub</a><br><p>This is a link to my GitHub, though you are already have found it in order to find this website. This assignment was to create this website and link it to the two others from the Notepad++, but I decided to use a template that I created before to show orignality and o make my page stand out while still appearing clean.</p></li>
